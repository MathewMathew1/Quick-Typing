# App Info

Created using t3 stack with command npm create t3-app@latest using next-auth for authorization.
Used mongodb and prisma for database. 
Used this exact technologies to speed up development, since they provide pretty good base ground to create app.

## What i would do in production difrently?
I would not use "any" keyword in few scenarios that i used it as dirty fix to make things faster
I would write tests along code, in this app i only setup testing env, but didnt have time to implement them. 
They are few scenario in code base that i added comment dirty, by this i meant that i would probably do things cleaner if i had more time. 
Would spend more time on trying implementing guests aka not authorized users. 

## Ai
I used ai to create data for text/qoutes that are used in game.
Used ai to create components with tailwind to speed up development.
